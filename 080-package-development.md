title: Package development
---

::: questions
- What is the best workflow for developing a Julia package?
- How can I prevent having to recompile every time I make a change?
:::

::: objectives
- Quick start with pkg> generate
- Basic structure of a package
- VSCode
- Revise.jl
:::

::: keypoints
- Currently, the editor with (by far) the best support is VSCode.
- The `Revise.jl` module can automatically reload parts of your code that have changed.
- Best practice: file names should reflect module names.
