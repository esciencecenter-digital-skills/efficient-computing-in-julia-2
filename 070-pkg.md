::: questions
- How do I work with environments?
- What are these `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files?
- How do I install more dependencies?
:::

::: objectives
- pkg> status
- pkg> add (in more details)
- pkg> remove 
- Project.toml
- Manifest.toml
- pkg> instantiate
- pkg> activate
- pkg> activate --temp
- pkg> activate @place

::: keypoints
- Julia has a built-in package manager called `Pkg`.
- The package manager is usually accessed from the REPL, by pressing `]`.
- `Project.toml` lists the dependencies of a package.
- `Manifest.toml` specifies a completely reproducible environment with exact versions.
