::: questions
- How do we distribute work across threads?
:::

::: objectives
- Change for-loops to run parallel.
- Launch tasks and generate results asynchronously.

---

::: keypoints
- Basic parallel for-loops are done with the `@threads` macro.
- Julia has built-in support for atomics.
- Channels are primary means of asynchronous communication.
